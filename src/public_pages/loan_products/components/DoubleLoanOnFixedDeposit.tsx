                  In the current economic situation, it is almost impossible to
                  get sufficient surety for any loan. Due to this situation,
                  Members are unable to secure new loans from Dhaka Credit.
                  Hence, Dhaka Credit has launched a new product “Double Loan on
                  Fixed Deposit” which is targeting Members who have sufficient
                  Fixed deposits but are unable to secure surety for a loan.
