              In the fifties, the economic condition of Christian community of
              this region was extremely bad. They had to borrow money at very
              high interest from the usurious moneylenders. Observing this
              situation, the then Archbishop Lawrence Leo Grenar, CSC became
              very anxious. He started thinking how the economic condition of
              these Christians could be developed. He sent Reverent Father
              Charles Joseph Young CSC to Coady Institute, Canada for training
              on Co-operative. After receiving training, Father Charles Joseph
              Young CSC established `The Christian Co-operative Credit Union
              Limited, Dhaka (Dhaka Credit)’ in 3rd July, 1955 at Luxmibazar
              with only 50 Members . With the establishment of Dhaka Credit, the
              Credit Union movement has been spaded though out the country
              afterword. Now, Dhaka Credit is the largest and oldest
              Co-operative Credit Union of its kind in Bangladesh. Dhaka Credit
              was awarded best cooperative award (Gold Medal) from the
              government of Bangladesh for its remarkable contributions in
              co-operative sectors.
